# Road-Accident-Prediction

Project Description :

This project implements developing a machine learning model which can classify the
severity of the accident, based on the accident influential factors. Various machine
learning classifiers such as Decision tree (DT), K- Nearest Neighbour (KNN),
Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Classifiers(GBC) used to develop a
predictive model. However, results show that a Gradient boosting algorithm is
capable of 90% accurately detecting the road accident severity. The results of the
comparative study suggest the Gradient Boosting Classifier could be a useful tool for
forecasting accident severity and the hotspots. Further, the model used in the web
portal to develop an intelligent system for the accident severity prediction.
